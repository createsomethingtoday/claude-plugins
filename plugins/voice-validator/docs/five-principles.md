# The Five Principles of Voice

The CREATE SOMETHING Voice is not a brand guideline—it's a philosophical commitment to clarity, honesty, and empirical rigor.

## 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

**Serve the reader, not the writer's ego.**

- Use simple words when simple words work
- Avoid jargon unless it's more precise than plain language
- If a sentence needs re-reading, rewrite it
- Every word should earn its place

### Test

Can a newcomer understand this on first read?

## 2. Specificity Over Generality

**Every claim must be measurable.**

- Replace "fast" with "47ms response time"
- Replace "many users" with "2,847 active users"
- Replace "significant improvement" with "34% reduction"
- If you can't measure it, question whether to claim it

### Test

Could someone verify this claim independently?

## 3. Honesty Over Polish

**Document failures and limitations.**

- Include "What This Doesn't Prove" sections
- Acknowledge when something didn't work
- Admit uncertainty rather than hedge
- Show the messy path, not just the clean result

### Test

Would a skeptic find this credible?

## 4. Useful Over Interesting

**Content must be implementable.**

- Provide actionable takeaways
- Include code, commands, or concrete steps
- Explain prerequisites and dependencies
- Make reproduction possible

### Test

Can someone do something with this information?

## 5. Grounded Over Trendy

**Connect to timeless principles.**

- Reference masters (Rams, Tufte, Heidegger)
- Use terminology that will age well
- Avoid buzzwords that will date the content
- Build on foundations, don't chase novelty

### Test

Will this still be relevant in 10 years?

## Forbidden Patterns

These words should never appear:

| Forbidden | Why | Alternative |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| cutting-edge | Trendy, vague | [describe what's new specifically] |
| revolutionary | Hyperbolic | [describe the change] |
| game-changing | Marketing speak | [describe the impact] |
| AI-powered | Buzzword | AI-native development |
| leverage | Corporate jargon | use |
| synergy | Empty | [describe the relationship] |
| solutions | Vague | [name the specific thing] |
| best-in-class | Unverifiable | [cite benchmark] |
| world-class | Unverifiable | [cite comparison] |
| industry-leading | Unverifiable | [cite ranking] |

## Terminology

| Wrong | Correct | Reason |
|-------|---------|--------|
| AI-assisted | AI-native development | More specific |
| AI-powered | AI-native development | More specific |
| projects | experiments | Reflects methodology |
| blog posts | papers | Reflects rigor |
| articles | papers | Reflects rigor |
| best practices | canonical standards | More grounded |
| style guide | canonical standards | More grounded |
| influences | masters | More reverent |
| inspiration | masters | More grounded |
